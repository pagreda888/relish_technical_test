Problem 1.1: The data enrichment(20 points)
Complete this section using JavaScript or TypeScript.

Given the latency existing on mobile networks, doing multiple API calls from the mobile app is not an option,
so you've been tasked with the creation of an external facing API endpoint which will provide the photo
information but will enrich it with the information of the album it belongs to, and the User, all in a single API
call.
For example, if you receive a request for /externalapi/photos/1, the expectation is to return the below
JSON which includes all the information as shown below:
